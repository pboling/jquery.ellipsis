## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, 
if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward 
compatibility, a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will 
only be introduced with new major versions.

As a result of this policy, you can (and should) specify a 
dependency on this gem using the [Pessimistic Version Constraint][pvc] with two digits of precision. 
For example:

    spec.add_dependency 'twitter', '~> 4.0'
