## Versioning

This library aims to adhere to [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0][semver].
Violations of this scheme should be reported as bugs. Specifically, 
if a minor or patch version is released that breaks backward 
compatibility, a new version should be immediately released that
restores compatibility. Breaking changes to the public API will 
only be introduced with new major versions.
